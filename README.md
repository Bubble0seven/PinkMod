Pink blocks need love too !

This is my first mod I wrote for a dear friend of mine who's making a modpack. It's probably not near perfect but it works as intended.

It adds 9 blocks :

- Pink Dirt

- Pink Grass

- Pink Farmland

- Pink Path

- Pink Coarse Dirt

- Pink Podzol

- Pink Stone

- Pink Cobbleston

- Pink Mossy Cobblestone

They behave like the vanilla variants.

<b>Note : The mod doesn't replace blocks in the world.</b>
